# Dynamic Model of Cocktail Party Nightmare
 Implementing a dynamic model of the cocktail party nightmare problem :)
---

## Installation of environment

Use the environment_cocktail_3.yml alongside conda in order to install all the pre-requistite packages needed to run these simulations. This can be come running;
> conda env create -f environment_cocktail_3.yml

---
## Parameters of the model 
For detailed description of the parameters used in model, please refer to ./dynamic_model/supporting_files/make_common_parameters.py.
---

## How to run one instance of the simulation
1. Initialize your parameters.
    ./dynamic_model/paramsets/ contains a set of example paramset files. Fill in your desired parameter values into the cells of the csv file. Be sure to stick to S.I. units while entering parameters. 

2. Change directories in the ./dynamic_model/simulation_and_plotting/simulation.py file
    change the OUTPUT_DIR (directory where the output is to be saved) and the PARAMETER_FILE_DIR (directory of the parameter file)

3. Run the ./dynamic_model/simulation_and_plotting/simulation.py file
    this runs one instance of the simulation. 

4. Change directories in the plotter.py or single_bat_plotter.py file
    change the OUTPUT_DIR (directory where the output of the simulation is saved) and SAVE_SIMULATION (False if animation need not be saved, else is the directory where the animation needs to be saved)

5. Run ./dynamic_model/simulation_and_plotting/plotter.py or ./dynamic_model/simulation_and_plotting/single_bat_plotter.py depending on the required type of animation and an animation will pop out as a window after it is processed! If a directory was specfied in SAVE_SIMULATION, video is rendered and stored as well.

## How to run for varying parameters
1. Run ./dynamic_model/supporting_files/make_common_parameters.py to generate the template parameter file. This parameter file is stored in ./dynamic_model/paramsets/common_parameters.csv and contains the defalt values of all the parameters.
2. An example to generate multiple paramsets is given in ./dynamic_model/paramsets/effect_of_group_size/make_paramset_effect_of_group_size.py. This can be modified for your specific use case.
3. In order to run the simulation over the newly generated parameter files, head to ./dynamic_model/simulation_multiple_parameters.py and change the following variables
    1. PARAM_DIR - the directory of the folder containing all the paraameter files you wish to run the simulation over
    2. N_RUNS - the numbr of runs each parameter file needs to be run for.
    3. DATA_STORAGE_DIR - the directory where data from all the simulation runs need to be stored. 
    4. MAX_WORKERS - if you wish to limit the number of cores assigned to running the simulation then set this to the desired number. If left blank, the max possible number of cores will be used.

## Implementation of intelligent movement 

1. You attract to "close" objects. However, if object is too close, you repel. 
2. Distance to an object is measured based on the intensity of sound. It uses intensity as a proxy for distance, self echoes are not treated differently. 
3. You only respond to the loudest sound that you receive, X seconds after your call. 
4. Attraction and Repuslion response strengths are linear (w spl). 
    - Say you attract to spls above 93 db and repel sounds above 98 db. The repulsion linear response scales from 93 to 98, with maximum allowed angle change being $\pm$ 0 degree at 93db and $\pm$ 180 degree at 98 dB.
5. Fixed angular speed of 6000 deg/s, 2015 vanderelst et al
